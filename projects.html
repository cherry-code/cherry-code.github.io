                        <p class="date">September 2023 - December 2023</p>
                        <p>I was assigned to look at TMAS Traffic Volume Data (<a href= "https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tables/tmasdata/">data obtained here</a>) and I attempted to understand what it means.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collaborated with 4 other team members to develop a machine learning model that will allow Verizon to decide in which geographical areas they should improve their network</li>
                            <li>Used data from various sources, including government sources and data cleaning using Python to make it suitable to use for the model</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>I worked on this website for the past two weeks. I took inspiration from some sample websites presented by a program that I'm part of. This is the resulting website. I hope to further improve this webbsite by using JavaScript on top of the HTML and CSS that I'm already using. Lesson from Codeacademy helped me gain an understanding on HTML and CSS.</p>
