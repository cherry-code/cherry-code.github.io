                <p id = "content">In the past month, I have been attending Breakthrough Tech AI, where I got to meet a lot of passionate people. Hearing them speak about their goals such as equity in the workplace made me realize that I was "living under a rock." I lacked the passion that these people had who were doing the same thing in life right now. I want to impact others for the better with the work I do in the future, in my career. I want people that do not get the same opportunities as others to feel just as confident to try something new.</p>
